Steps:

MainScreen(Score page and start button)
Score page(Scores) *Figure out how to keep scores from previous games.
Game(immersive full screen canvas with jack ball)



Game(boules): 2 player balls (3 each)
*planb: 1 player with obstacles

idea: player throws ball with touching, can control ball with accelerometer (which wont affect "forth and back" only sideways), negative acceleration/time limit, collisions transfer acceleration. Bounces are NOT controlled by accelerometer.

Score: adding distance of 3 balls to jack. Lowest distance wins. 2 Player score separated(player 1 balls and player 2 balls need to be tracked).

Style: Later concern. Image in main screen, maybe some colour. Back ground in all screen (grass?). com.example.ja86.a8project.Jack white, player1 red, player 2 blue. Maybe use jpg image for balls.

jack (littloe white target)

Winer gets a screen asking for name to register his score. Loser is rewarded with anonymity.
